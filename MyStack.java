 * In MyStack, you will write your own stack. 
 * It will have its own push, pop, and peek methods just like a real stack. 
 * You can't use Java's library stack, since the point is to implement it from scratch.
 * 
 * How will you design MyStack?
 * What fields will MyStack have and will you use any data structures?
 * Are there considerations for time and space efficiency you can take?
 * 
 * Whatever design you choose, please write a detailed explanation why you chose it
 * versus other options you thought of. What are the benefits of it over other designs?
 * This is important since it'll help you practice coding in a smart way and it'll help
 * you articulate your ideas to interviewers. 
 * 
 * Try designing this with pen and paper first before you start to code.
 * All fields and methods you add to this file must be PRIVATE and you can only use
 * the constructor, push, pop, and peek in main. 
 * 
 * 
 * For simplicity, your stack will hold ints.
